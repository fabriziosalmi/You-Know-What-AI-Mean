# Sub-Project Introduction

Welcome to this sub-project! This is a unique initiative aimed at creating a comprehensive list of YouTube channels that fall into a specific subset: they are AND/OR promote  **faceless**, **fully automated**, **monetized**, and **deliver arguable content most of the time specifically for children**.

The purpose of this project is to raise awareness about the potential risks associated with such channels. By making this information publicly available, we hope to hold both YouTube and the creators of these channels accountable in the event of any legal actions.

This list will be updated regularly as we continue to identify channels that meet these criteria. We believe in the power of collective action and transparency, and we invite you to join us in this endeavor to make YouTube a safer platform for our children.
